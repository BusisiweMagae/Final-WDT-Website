            Welcome to our website, where you can simply find and compare the cost of living in major cities worldwide. Our objective is to give customers with an easy-to-use platform that allows them to obtain vital information about various nations and capital cities. This knowledge, we feel, is critical for those who are preparing to relocate or visit to a new nation, as well as those who are inquisitive about the globe.
            </p>


            <p>

            Our website is driven by two APIs: the country-facts API and the cost-of-living API, both of which supply us with the data we need to compile a complete database of information about each country's capital. We display the location of each capital city using mapping tools such as Google Maps or Bing Maps.
